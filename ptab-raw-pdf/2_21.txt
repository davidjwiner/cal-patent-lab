Before JOHN G. NEW, ELIZABETH A. LAVIER, and TAWEN CHANG,
Administrative Patent Judges.
LAVIER, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellants seek reversal of the
Examiner's rejection of claims 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7-9. We have jurisdiction
under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM.
BACKGROUND
The Specification describes antimicrobial medical devices,
particularly contact lenses, with silver nanoparticles distributed therein, and

methods for making the same. See Spec. 1:6-9; 2:15-3:4. Claim 1 is
illustrative:
1. A method for making an antimicrobial contact lens,

comprises the steps of:
obtaining a polymerizable dispersion comprising in-situ formed
Ag-nanoparticles and a silicone-containing monomer or
macromer or prepolymer;
reducing a yellowish color of the Ag-nanoparticles-containing
polymerizable dispersion by treating the Ag-nanoparticlescontaining polymerizable dispersion with chloride;
introducing an amount of the chloride[ 2 ]-treated polymerizable
dispersion in a mold for making an antimicrobial contact lens;
and
polymerizing the chloride-treated polymerizable dispersion in
the mold to form the antimicrobial contact lens containing Agnanoparticles,
wherein the step of reducing a yellowish color of the Agnanoparticles-containing polymerizable dispersion by treating
the Ag-nanoparticles-containing polymerizable dispersion with
chloride is performed according to either procedure A or
procedure B or combination thereof,
wherein the procedure A comprises: (1) adding chloride salt in
solid form, directly into the dispersion; (2) mixing thoroughly
resultant mixture for a period of time long enough to reduce the
yellowish color of Ag-nanoparticles-containing polymerizable
dispersion;
and (3) removing remaining solid chloride salt,

The Claims Appendix includes an apparent marked-up edit to this word:
"chloritge." Appeal Br. 11 (Claims Appendix). This same edit appeared in
the Claim Amendments filed on January 21, 2014, and the Examiner
acknowledged this change in withdrawing an objection to claim 1 in the
Final Office Action (see Final Action 2). Accordingly, we assume that the
inclusion of this markup in the Claims Appendix was inadvertent, and omit
the markup here.

wherein the procedure B comprises: (1) adding a NaCl or
hydrochloride solution into the polymerizable dispersion and
(2) mixing thoroughly resultant mixture for a period of time
long enough to reduce the yellowish color of Ag-nanoparticlescontaining polymerizable dispersion.
Appeal Br. 11 (Claims Appendix).
REJECTION MAINTAINED ON APPEAL
Claims 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7-9 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103, as
unpatentable over Qiu3 and Pritchard. 4 Ans. 2.
DISCUSSION
Qiu teaches an antimicrobial contact lens containing distributed silver
nanoparticles (see Qiu Abstract). The Examiner relies on Qiu to teach all of
the limitations of the rejected claims (see Final Action 3--4), except for those
limitations relating to "treating either the silver nanoparticles or
polymerizable solution with chloride ion," and "the resulting color change"
(id. at 4). For those aspects of the claims, the Examiner turns to Pritchard's

disclosure that "silver nanoparticles carry a yellowish color indicating that
the nanoparticles have indeed formed" (id. at 4 (citing Pritchard i-f 147)) and
that "this coloring may be reduced or removed ... by treatment with a
sodium chloride solution, which Pritchard believes is the result of the
formation of silver chloride" (id. (citing Pritchard i-f 148)). The Examiner
finds one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine
Qiu and Pritchard in the manner claimed, because:

Appeal2015-001500
Application 12/011,652
the contact lenses of Qiu ordinarily require optical clarity to
properly function as contact lenses, and Pritchard not only
discloses a method of reducing or eliminating discoloration
caused by the antimicrobial silver contained in the lenses of
Qiu, but also indicates that the antimicrobial efficacy of such
silver particles can be improved by treatment with chloride ion.

Id. at 5.
Appellants argue that there are "at least two big differences" between
the claims and Pritchard: (1) Pritchard teaches "the yellow color disappears
in certain gels," not polymerizable dispersions; and (2) in the claims, "the
dispersion is treated with chloride and yellow color is reduced before
introducing into the mold," whereas in Pritchard, "the gel is formed first and
then extruded to a bath containing physiological saline and then yellow color
is reduced." Appeal Br. 6.
We are unpersuaded. The Examiner employs Pritchard only for a
very narrow purpose, i.e., Pritchard's teaching of the effect of chloride
exposure on silver nanoparticles. As the Examiner puts it; Appellants'
arguments "ignore[] the explicitly recited trees of basic chemistry provided
by Pritchard for the forest of specific and exemplary medical devices
Pritchard describes." Ans. 6. The Examiner further explains:
Pritchard equally clearly attributes the removal of such
yellowish tint, arising out of the presence of the aforementioned
silver nanoparticles, to the exposure to and reaction with
chloride ion to provide an equally, if not more advantageous,
silver chloride nanoparticle. This represents a fundamental
teaching of basic inorganic chemistry, in that it is clear to any
skilled artisan from this disclosure that a yellowish silver
nanoparticle exposed to, and therefore reacted with chloride ion
reduces the yellowish appearance of that nanoparticle.
Ans. 7. Furthermore, Appellants' attempts to distinguish the references from
the claimed invention based on the point in the process at which chloride
4

Appeal2015-001500
Application 12/011,652
exposure occurs are not persuasive because, as the Examiner notes, "the
mere rearrangement of process steps cannot, absent unexpected results,
distinguish a claimed invention from prior art which rearranges known
process steps." Ans. 7 (citing In re Burhans, 154 F.2d 690 (CCPA 1946)).
Appellants retort that the post-curing phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
exposure data from Qiu indeed show that the results of the claimed invention
are unexpected. See Reply Br. 3. We are not persuaded that Qiu's data
regarding the effect of saline (i.e., chloride) exposure after the lens itself has
already been manufactured (Qiu packages and autoclaves the completed
lenses in PBS, see Qiu i-f 406) have any bearing on whether one of skill in
the art would have expected chloride to have an effect during the process of
lens-making. Accordingly, as applied to chloride exposure during the
process of making lenses, we agree with the Examiner that "[ n ]othing of Qiu
actually contradicts the teachings of Pritchard concerning the ability of
chloride ion to remove the yellowish tint associated with the presence of
antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in gel medical devices." Ans. 5---6. As
Appellants have not demonstrated unexpected results from the order of steps
as arranged in claim 1, Appellants have not shown that their arrangement of
steps is nonobvious over the alternative arrangements of steps in the prior
art.
Additionally, Appellants argue that Pritchard is directed to a different
technical field than Qiu, i.e., occlusive, swellable medical devices rather
than contact lenses, and seeks to solve different problems. See Appeal Br.
8-9. Accordingly, Appellants maintain that one of skill in the art of contact
lenses would not have consulted Pritchard, and, even if they had done so,
would not have had a reasonable expectation of success in arriving at the
5

Appeal2015-001500
Application 12/011,652
claimed invention. See id. at 9. Appellants thus attribute the Examiner's
rejection to impermissible hindsight reconstruction. See id.
These arguments are also unpersuasive, and attribute an overly narrow
range of interest and creativity to the person of ordinary skill in the art. Cf
KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 420-21 (2007) (explaining that

a person with ordinary skill in the art is "a person of ordinary creativity, not
an automaton," and "in many cases ... will be able to fit the teachings of
multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle"). The distinctions between
the references highlighted by Appellants (see Appeal Br. 8-9) do not
convince us that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have considered
both references. Both Qiu and Pritchard teach using silver nanoparticles for
antibacterial purposes in biomedical polymeric compositions, and recognize
that the silver nanoparticles can cause an undesirable yellowish color. As
quoted above, the Examiner explains that Qiu's quest for optical clarity in
contact lenses would have motivated the ordinarily skilled artisan to modify
Qiu with Pritchard's method for eliminating the discoloration caused by
antimicrobial silver nanoparticles, as well as for enhancing the antimicrobial
effect. See Final Action 5.
Furthermore, whether two references are analogous art is determined
by two separate tests: "(1) whether the art is from the same field of
endeavor, regardless of the problem addressed and, (2) if the reference is not
within the field of the inventor's endeavor, whether the reference still is
reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor is
involved." In re Bigio, 381F.3d1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Even if we
accept, arguendo, Appellants' argument that the references are from
different fields of endeavor, Pritchard is still pertinent to the particular
6

Appeal2015-001500
Application 12/011,652
problem taught by Qiu, viz., reducing the yellowing cause by the formation
of silver nanoparticles.
Having considered all of Appellants' arguments, we are unpersuaded
that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1 over Qiu and Pritchard.
Appellants argue claim 5 together with claim 1, and offer no separate
arguments for the dependent claims. Accordingly, claims 2, 4, 5, and 7-9
fall with claim 1. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
CONCLUSION
The rejection of claims 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7-9 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) is
affirmed for the reasons of record and as explained herein.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
