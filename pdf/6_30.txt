DECISION ON APPEAL
This appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) involves claims to active
ingredient combinations, useful for the treatment of undesired body odor.
The Examiner rejected the claims for obviousness.
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). We affirm.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The sole rejection before us for review is the Examiner's rejection of
claims 34, 35, 41, and 43 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) for obviousness over

(US 2005/0119313 Al, published June 2, 2005 (hereinafter "Behrends")).
Final Action 3-11.
Claims 34 and 35 are representative and read as follows (Br. 15):
34
An active ingredient combination, comprising:
a)
8 to 30% by weight of 1-(2-ethylhexyl) glycerol ether;
b)
0.8 to 3.0% by weight of octenidine dihydrochloride;
40 to 88% by weight of 1,2-propylene glycol; and
c)
d)
0.003 to 0.02% by weight of vitamin E,
wherein the sum of components a), b) and d) to component c)
has a weight ratio of 1:4 to 1:5,
wherein the active ingredient combination is free from aliphatic
alcohol,
wherein the active ingredient combination is free from amine
oxide.

35.
a)
b)
c)
d)

The combination according to claim 34, comprising:
14 to 18% by weight of 1-(2-ethylhexyl) glycerol ether;
1.4 to 1.8% by weight of octenidine dihydrochloride;
70 to 85% by weight of 1,2-propylene glycol; and
0.006 to 0.010% by weight of vitamin E.
OBVIOUSNESS

In rejecting claims 34 and 35 for obviousness, the Examiner found
that, except for octenidine dihydrochloride, the '097 App. reasonably
suggested compositions including all of the ingredients required by the
claims, in the concentrations recited in the claims. Final Action 3-8. The
Examiner noted in particular that, although the '097 App. taught that

2

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
antimicrobial additives were suitable in its compositions, octenidine
dihydrochloride was not among the antimicrobial compounds listed. Id. at 8.
To address that deficiency, the Examiner cited the '612 App. as
describing the use of octenidine dihydrochloride in compositions containing
the same glycerol monoalkyl ether present in the compositions of the '097
App., and also teaching that "the presence of octenidine dihydrochloride
improved the solubility of the glycerol monoalkyl ether in water (paragraph
[0056]) and that the combination exhibited fast acting disinfecting activity."
Id. at 8-9.
Based on the references' teachings, the Examiner concluded that an
ordinary artisan would have considered it obvious "to modify the
compositions suggested by the '097 App. by adding 0.1 to 2% octenidine
dihydrochloride to improve the antimicrobial activity of the composition, as
taught by the '612 App." Id. at 9. The Examiner reasoned that an ordinary
artisan "would have had a high expectation of success because the '612 App.
suggests that combining 1-(2-ethylhexyl)glycerol ether, octenidine
dihydrochloride, and 1,2-propylene glycol is advantageous for solubility of
1-(2-ethylhexyl) glycerol ether, and efficacy of the octenidine
dihydrochloride." Id.
The Examiner found, moreover, that based on the teachings of
suitable concentration ranges of ingredients in the compositions described in
the '097 App. and the '612 App., and ordinary artisan would have arrived at
a composition meeting the ratio for the sum of the components recited in
claim 34. Final Action 9-10.
As to the requirement for the compositions of claims 34 and 35 to be
free from aliphatic alcohols and amine oxides, the Examiner noted that
3

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
neither of those ingredients is a required component of the compositions of
either the '097 App. or the '612 App. Id. at 10. The Examiner nonetheless
cited the '742 App. and Behrends as evidence that those components were
known in the art to undesirable in compositions to be applied to the skin,
and, therefore, would desirably have been omitted from the compositions of
the '097 App. and the '612 App. Id. at 10-11.
As stated in In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992):
[T]he examiner bears the initial burden . . . of presenting a
primafacie case ofunpatentability....
After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant
in response, patentability is determined on the totality of the
record, by a preponderance of evidence with due consideration
to persuasiveness of argument.
Appellants' arguments do not persuade us that a preponderance of the
evidence fails to support the Examiner's prima facie case of obviousness.
As to claim 34, Appellants first contend that the cited references do
not suggest a composition having the claimed concentrations of the recited
ingredients, because the composition in the '097 App. identified by the
Examiner as providing the claimed concentration range of the recited
glycerol ether is a concentrated working solution that is intended to be
diluted to produce a final composition suitable for cosmetic or
pharmaceutical use. Br. 6-7. In contrast, Appellants contend, the
compositions in the '612 App. identified by the Examiner as including a
concentration of octenidine dihydrochloride encompassed by claim 34 are
final compositions. Id. at 7-8. Therefore, Appellants contend, "the
combination of the teachings from the '097 App. and the '612 App., contrary
to the Examiner's position, does not teach 8-30% of 1-(2-ethylhexyl)
4

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
glycerol ether and 0.01-2% of octenidine dihydrochloride" as required by
claim 34. Id. at 9.
Moreover, Appellants contend, because the concentration of
octenidine dihydrochloride taught in the '612 App. is the concentration used
in final compositions, whereas the concentration of glycerol ether relied
upon by the Examiner to meet claim 34' s glycerol ether concentration is
present in a more concentrated working solution in the '097 App., an
ordinary artisan would not have expected the octenidine hydrochloride at the
concentrations in the '612 App. to improve the solubility of glycerol ethers
at the higher concentration of the '097 App.'s working solution. Id. at 9-10.
Appellants' arguments, thus, are essentially that an ordinary artisan
would not have had a reason to include claim 34' s concentration of
octenidine dihydrochloride in the working solutions of the '097 App.,
because the '612 App. teaches that octenidine hydrochloride at the claimed
concentration should only be combined with glycerol ethers when the ethers
are present at concentrations lower than present in the working solutions of
the '097 App. We are not persuaded.
As the Supreme Court has explained, in determining whether the prior
art supplied a reason for practicing the claimed subject matter, the analysis
"need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of
the challenged claim, for a court can take account of the inferences and
creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ." KSR
Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007); see also id. at 421 ("A

person of ordinary skill is ... a person of ordinary creativity, not an
automaton.").

5

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
In the instant case, the '097 App. teaches compositions that are
amenable to a variety of cosmetic/pharmaceutical applications, including
deodorants, skin disinfectants, and antimicrobial washes. '097 App. i-f 53.
The '097 App. compositions undisputedly include the glycerol ether recited
in claim 34 (id. at i-fi-1 1-3), the propylene glycol recited in claim 34 (id. at i-f
37), and the vitamin E recited in claim 34 (id. at i-f 30). Although the '097
App. might not include the octenidine hydrochloride recited in claim 34, the
'097 App. teaches that its compositions may contain antimicrobial active
ingredients. Id. at i-f 37.
The '612 App. also teaches compositions that are amenable to a
variety of pharmaceutical applications, including hand and skin
disinfectants, antimicrobial washes, and bath additives. '612 App. i-f 12. In
addition to teaching the inclusion of octenidine dihydrochloride in its
compositions (id. at i-f 16), the '612 App. compositions undisputedly include
the glycerol ether recited in claim 34 (id. at i-f 14), and the propylene glycol
recited in claim 34 (id. at i-f 19).
The '612 App. discloses that "the water-solubility of glycerol
monomenthyl [sic, monoalkyl?] ether is significantly improved by the
addition of the bispyridiniumalkane (especially octenidine
dihydrochloride)." Id. at i-f 49; see also id. at i-f 56 (The presence of
bispyridiniumalkane in the compositions according to the invention leads to
a significantly improved solubility in water of the glycerol monoalkyl
ether."). The '612 App. discloses that, because glycerol monoalkyl ethers
were known as antimicrobial, as opposed to microbicidal compounds, it was
"surprising that glycerol mono alkyl ethers contribute in the compositions
according to the invention to the hand-disinfectant effect." Id. at i-f 50.
6

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
Given the '097 App.' s disclosure of the desirability of including
antimicrobial compounds in its compositions, we agree with the Examiner
that an ordinary artisan would have included the known antimicrobial agent
octenidine dihydrochloride in the '097 App. 's compositions, particularly
given the '612 App.'s disclosures of the improvements that result from
combining octenidine dihydrochloride with compositions containing
precisely the ingredients in the '097 App. 's compositions.
We acknowledge, as Appellants contend, that the composition
identified by the Examiner as meeting the 8 to 30% by weight glycerol ether
concentration requirement of claim 34 is described as a "working solution
[which] comprises 60% by weight or less, preferably 40% by weight or less,
more preferably 20% by weight or less, of glycerol mono alkyl ethers." '097
App. ii 50.
We acknowledge, as Appellants also contend, that the composition in
the '612 App. identified by the Examiner as meeting claim 34's octenidine
dihydrochloride concentration of 0.8 to 3.0% by weight has, in "a preferred
embodiment, ... in the range from 0.01 to 2% by weight, more preferably
0.02 to 1.5% by weight, in particular 0.04 to 0.6% by weight, such as 0.06 to
0.2% by weight, for example about 0.1 % by weight" of that component.
'612App.ii17.
As Appellants contend, in contrast to the up to 60% of the glycerol
ether in working solution ofil 50 of the '097 App., the '612 App. discloses
that, in its compositions, the "content of glycerol monoalkyl ether is
generally in the range from 0.03 to 5% by weight, preferably 0.05 to 3% by
weight, more preferably 0.1 to 1 % by weight, such as 0.15 to 0.5% by
weight, for example about 0.25% by weight." '612 App. ii 15.
7

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
Nonetheless, we agree with the Examiner (Ans. 4-7) that, although
the '612 App. teaches that its preferred 0.01to2% by weight concentration
of octenidine dihydrochloride is used in compositions that include glycerol
ethers at a concentration somewhat less than that of the working solutions of
the '097 App., an ordinary artisan would have reasonably inferred that, even
when employed at a concentration of 0.01to2% by weight, the octenidine
dihydrochloride would impart its known antimicrobial properties to the '097
App. 's working composition. Indeed, as the Examiner points out (Ans. 6),
by disclosing the use of its compositions as bath additives ('612 App. i-f 12),
the '612 App. suggests that octenidine dihydrochloride retains its
disinfectant properties even upon significant dilution.
Appellants, moreover, do not direct us to any specific teaching in any
of the cited references, or persuasive evidence elsewhere in the record,
suggesting that the antimicrobial and glycerol ether-solubilizing properties
of octenidine dihydrochloride would have been expected only when
combined with glycerol ethers at the concentrations taught in the '612 App.
To that end, we note that Appellants direct us to no persuasive evidence
suggesting that the claimed combination of known elements, even at the
claimed concentrations, produces a composition having properties beyond
those expected by an ordinary artisan. Cf KSR, 550 U.S. at 417 ("[W]hen a
patent simply arranges old elements with each performing the same function
it had been known to perform and yields no more than one would expect
from such an arrangement, the combination is obvious.") (internal quotations
omitted).
In sum, for the reasons discussed, Appellants' arguments do not
persuade us that a preponderance of the evidence fails to support the

8

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
Examiner's prima facie case of obviousness as to claim 34. Accordingly, we
affirm the Examiner's rejection of that claim, as well as claims 41 and 43,
which were argued in the same grouping. See Br. 5.
As to claim 35, Appellants present similar arguments. See Br. 10-13.
While we acknowledge that claim 35 recites a narrower concentration range
than claim 34 for glycerol ethers (14 to 18% by weight (Br. 15)), claim 35's
concentration range is entirely encompassed within the suitable ranges
taught for that ingredient in the '097 App. 's working solutions ("more
preferably 20% by weight or less" ('097 App. i-f 50)).
As to claim 35 's octenidine dihydrochloride concentration, 1.4 to
1.8% by weight (Br. 15), the '612 App. discloses octenidine dihydrochloride
in "a preferred embodiment, ... in the range from 0.01to2% by weight"
('612 App. i-f 17), a range entirely overlapping the claimed range.
Again, that the '612 App. discloses including those concentrations of
octenidine hydrochloride in compositions having glycerol ether
concentrations somewhat lower than the '097 App. 's working solution (see
'612 App. i-f 15) does not persuade us that an ordinary artisan would have
failed to recognize, based on the teachings in the '612 App. discussed above,
that including 0.01 to 2% by weight octenidine hydrochloride in the working
solutions of the '097 App. would result in a solution having enhanced
antimicrobial and glycerol ether-solubilizing properties. Appellants do not
direct us to specific persuasive evidence supporting their arguments to the
contrary. Nor do Appellants direct us to specific persuasive evidence
suggesting that the compositions recited in claim 3 5 possess unexpected
properties. Cf KSR, 550 U.S. at 417 ("[W]hen a patent simply arranges old
elements with each performing the same function it had been known to
9

Appeal2014-001933
Application 12/864,301
perform and yields no more than one would expect from such an
arrangement, the combination is obvious.") (internal quotations omitted).
In sum, for the reasons discussed, Appellants' arguments do not
persuade us that a preponderance of the evidence fails to support the
Examiner's prima facie case of obviousness as to claim 35. Accordingly, we
affirm the Examiner's rejection of that claim over the cited references.
SUMMARY
For the reasons discussed, we affirm the Examiner's rejection of
claims 34, 35, 41, and 43 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) for obviousness over the
'097 App., the '612 App., the '742 App., and Behrends.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a).
